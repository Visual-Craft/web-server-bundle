WebServerBundle
===============

WebServerBundle provides commands for running applications using the PHP
built-in web server. It simplifies your local development setup because you
don't have to configure a proper web server such as Apache or Nginx to run your
application.

This bundle is based on `symfony/web-server-bundle`.

Differences
